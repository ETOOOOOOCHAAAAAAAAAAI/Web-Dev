        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br> Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>.Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6:</strong><br>Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 7: </strong><br>Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 8:</strong><br>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 9: </strong><br>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle with pepper oil.</p>

        <p><strong>Dought: </strong><br>
            Sift the flour through the sieve into a mixing bowl.<br>
Add salt to a cup of warm water and mix until dissolved.<br>
Combine the water with flour and kneed the dough to form a dough ball. It took 10 minutes in the stand mixer.<br>
Cover the dough ball and leave to rest for 30 min.<br>
Once rested, sprinkle the working surface with a little flour and roll the dough into a thin rectangular sheet approximately 2-3mm or 1/8 inch thick.<br>
Cover the sheet with melted ghee.<br>
Starting on one edge, roll the dough tightly like a cigar.<br>
Cut the roll into 18 equal pieces.<br>
Press each piece with palm of your hand to make a patty.<br>
Stack patties with parchment paper between them in an airtight container, and place in the fridge to chill for at least 3 hours or overnight.<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Filling: </strong><br>
            Combine all the ingredients and mix well. Leave to rest for at least 30 minutes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Assembly: </strong><br>
            Take the dough patties out of the fridge and roll each patty out into a thin circle sheet using a rolling pin.<br> Roll on one side only and never flip the dough.<br>
Divide the filling between each circle evenly.<br>
Bring two opposite sides together making a triangle. Pinch the corners. Then bring the bottom part and pinch together again. (Refer to picture guide for visual help.)<br>
Put the samsa on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper seem side down.<br>
Cover with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using.<br>
Bake at 385 F for 30 minutes or until golden.<br>
