        <p>Visiting China was like stepping into a world where ancient history and modern innovation coexist beautifully. I started my journey in Beijing, wandering through the narrow hutongs and marveling at the grandeur of the Great Wall of China. Shanghai, on the other hand, amazed me with its stunning contrast: futuristic skyscrapers alongside the historic Bund.</p>
        <h2 id="2post">What i ate?</h2>
        <p>The food was an adventure on its own. I tried everything I could! The famous Peking duck was perfection—crispy, juicy, and full of flavor. Dim sum felt like little bites of joy, especially the shrimp ones. Spicy noodles warmed me up after long walks, and I even dared to taste fried milk—unique but surprisingly delicious.</p>
        <h2 id="3post">What i see?</h2>
        <p>Among all the sights, the Forbidden City stood out the most—a massive palace complex brimming with history. I also couldn’t forget the mesmerizing Chinese opera show, with its vibrant costumes, music, and movements—it felt like stepping into a different world. China left me with unforgettable memories, and I know I’ll return one day.</p>
