    <body> <h1>Mary's Lamb</h1>
    <p>
        Mary had a little lamb,<br>
Its fleece was white as snow,<br>
And everywhere that Mary went<br>
The lamb was sure to go;<br>
He followed her to school one day—<br>
That was against the rule,<br>
It made the children laugh and play,<br>
To see a lamb at school.<br>
